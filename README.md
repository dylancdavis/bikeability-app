# Bikeability App

There isn't too much to look at yet for this project, as it's in the early stages of development. However, the goal for this project is to provide a website that will allow a user to search up a city and see how "Bikable" it is- through a combination of user reviews, external reviews, and other metrics. Stay tuned!
